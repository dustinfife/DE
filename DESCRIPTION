Description: This procedure attempts to find "confounding models," or models
    that fit approximately as well as the model of interest. It does so by
    randomly generating a large number of models, fitting them to the data,
    then comparing their fits to the fit of the model of interest. Those models
    that exceed the substantive model if fit are flagged for later analysis.
